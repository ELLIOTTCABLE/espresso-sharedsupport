CodeSense Providers map contexts in a document to possible completions. The actual completions are defined in the various CodeSense libraries, categorized using their key. A CodeSense Provider tells Espresso what CodeSense libraries are active in the current context. One of these XML files can contain many <provider> elements.

		<!-- The selector element specifies in what document contexts the provider is active. -->
		<selector>css > property-name:capture(name) + property-value - punctuation.separator, css > property-name:capture(name) + property-value > punctuation.terminator</selector>
		
		<!-- The completions element points to the CodeSense Library key that has to be used. It can contain placeholders for captured pieces of text from the selector. -->

		<!-- The complete-match element defines a regular expression for the piece of text that is completed by this provider. It's not necessary to append an end-of-line symbol: this happens automatically. Note that even if this provider is active in the current context, and the expression is matched, it may still be ignored for a completion if other providers match a different piece of the same text. -->

		<!-- The require-suffix element (optional) defines a regular expression which the text *after* the completion has to match. It's not necessary to prepend a begin-of-line symbol: this happens automatically. -->
